# Project Constellation — Infra & CI scaffold

This branch contains minimal infra and CI scaffolding to start development:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — baseline CI (lint, test, build)
- infra/README.md — placeholder for Terraform / infra notes
- .github/CODEOWNERS — initial code ownership

Add more infra and pipeline steps iteratively.
