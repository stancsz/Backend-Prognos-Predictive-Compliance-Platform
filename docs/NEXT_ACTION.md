# Next action (pick one)

I reviewed the repository and implemented preliminary TODOs, API endpoints, and demo-runner wiring. Pick one of these next steps and I will implement it next (one change at a time):

- A — Add a minimal mapping web UI (packages/web) to perform evidence → control mapping and view project summary.
- B — Update README and docs to explicitly document the new mapping step and local demo commands.
- C — Add a CI smoke job that runs the demo-runner and fails on regression.
- D — Implement simple rule-based mapping suggestions in the worker and expose a suggestion endpoint.

Reply with the letter (A, B, C, or D) of the task you want me to do next.
