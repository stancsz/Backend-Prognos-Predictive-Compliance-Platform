# Choose next action

I reviewed the repo and prepared next-step options. Please reply with a single letter: A, B, C, or D.

Options:
- A — Add a minimal mapping web UI (packages/web) to perform evidence → control mapping and view project summary.
- B — Update README and docs to explicitly document the new mapping step and local demo commands.
- C — Add a CI smoke job that runs the demo-runner and fails on regression.
- D — Implement simple rule-based mapping suggestions in the worker and expose a suggestion endpoint.

Reply with the letter of the task you want implemented next.
